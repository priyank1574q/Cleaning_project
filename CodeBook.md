[Raw dataset link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

The raw data was downloaded and was stored in the working directory of RStudio. You can also store the raw data in different location but then you'll have to change the working directory with 
```{r}
setwd()
```


## Details-
1. `run_analysis.R`, the R script that was used to create the dataset. (The method of creation is mentioned in the next section)
2. `README.md`, this file provides an overview of the data set and how it was created.
3. `Instructions.md`, it contains the instructions given on how to make the dataset. [Coursera Project Link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/peer/FIZtT/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project)
4. `CodeBook.md`, the code book describes the contents of the data set (data, variables and transformations used to generate the data).
5. `tidy_data.txt`, the final tidy dataset.
